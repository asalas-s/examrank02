Write a program that takes a string and displays its last word followed by a \n.

A word is a section of string delimited by spaces/tabs or by the start/end of
the string.

If the number of parameters is not 1, or there are no words, display a newline.

Example:

$> ./a.out "FOR PONY" | cat -e
PONY$
$> ./a.out "this        ...       is sparta, then again, maybe    not" | cat -e
not$
$> ./a.out "   " | cat -e
$
$> ./a.out "a" "b" | cat -e
$
$> ./a.out "  lorem,ipsum  " | cat -e
lorem,ipsum$
$>
